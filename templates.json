  ";kyc": "Special Instant Account: Achieve 2.5% profit, maintain 20% consistency, and have at least 5 profitable days.\n\nInstant Pro Account: Achieve 4% profit, maintain 20% consistency, and have at least 5 profitable days.\n\nOnce all these requirements are met, you can open a ticket on our Discord or website support, or send us an email showing your eligibility. After verification, we will send you the KYC link via email within 48 business hours, and you can proceed to complete your KYC.",
  ";consis": "Your consistency should be less than or equal to 20% to request a withdrawal. You will get 20% consistency only when you divide your highest profit in a day by 0.2 and achieve that target. Also, you must not make any day’s profit higher than your highest profit day.\n\nExample:\nIf your highest profit in a single day is $50, then:\n50 ÷ 0.2 = $250 (this becomes your total required profit for 20% consistency)\n\nSo, you must keep every other day’s profit below $50, and your total profit should reach $250 or more to meet the 20% consistency requirement.",
  ";sl-rule": "Yes, all trades in the live phase must have a Stop Loss in place. While it doesn’t have to be set at the very start of the trade, it must be added before closing the trade.\n\nTrades without a Stop Loss are considered a violation of our rules. Depending on the severity, the Payout Processing Team may take actions such as profit split adjustments, account reset, or, in extreme cases, a hard breach.",
